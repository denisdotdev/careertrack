## 🔄 Versioning

This project uses automatic semantic versioning based on [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). The versioning system automatically runs on the main branch and:

- **Bumps patch version** (0.1.0 → 0.1.1) for bug fixes (`fix:` commits)
- **Bumps minor version** (0.1.0 → 0.2.0) for new features (`feat:` commits)  
- **Bumps major version** (0.1.0 → 1.0.0) for breaking changes (`BREAKING CHANGE` or `!:` commits)

### Commit Message Format

Follow the conventional commit format for automatic versioning:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Examples:**
- `feat: add user authentication system` (bumps minor)
- `fix: resolve login validation issue` (bumps patch)
- `feat!: remove deprecated API` (bumps major - breaking change)

### Branch Naming

- `feature/*` - New features (use `feat:` commits)
- `hotfix/*` - Bug fixes (use `fix:` commits)
- `release/*` - Major releases (use `BREAKING CHANGE` commits)

### Automatic Actions

- Version numbers are automatically updated in both `composer.json` and `package.json`
- Changelog is automatically generated and updated
- GitHub releases are created when pushing to main branch
- Git tags are created for each version
- Version changes are automatically synced to the develop branch
- Versioning only occurs on the main branch for safety
